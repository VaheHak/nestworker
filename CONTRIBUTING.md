Before running the unit tests youâ€™ll need to install, `npm i`, [development dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#devdependencies). Run unit tests from the command-line via `npm test`.

## Coding Guidelines

In addition to the following guidelines, please follow the conventions already established in the code.

- **Spacing**:<br>
  Use two spaces for indentation. No tabs.

- **Quotes**:<br>
  Single-quoted strings are preferred to double-quoted strings; however,
  please use a double-quoted string if the value contains a single-quote
  character to avoid unnecessary escaping.

Guidelines are enforced using [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint):

```bash
$ npm run lint
```
